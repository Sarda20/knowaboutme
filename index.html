	<div class="textfont">
		<p> I am <b>Anirudh Sarda</b> currently studying CSE in <a href="https://www.bracu.ac.bd/"> Brac University</a>  and <em>my hometown</em> is Dinajpur. Before that i completed my O'Level and A'Level from <a href="http://www.siscd.edu.bd/single/30">Scholars International School</a>. First before getting into Brac i was not sure about which major to choose because I was really confused between Computer Science and Architecture as I was passionate for both but after spending few years getting to know the bare basics of Computer Science I can confidently say that I am really happy with the major I chose.  </p>

	<div class="textfont">

	<p>My hobbies are reading books, playing outdoor games and watching movies and TV series. I spend most of my free times doing all this. All this activities are a happy booster for me and this also makes me creative.</p> </br>

			<h3 class="c">Books</h3>
			
					My love for reading books started at a young age when i used to read <i>Harry Potter</i> books and it kept growing. What I truly treasure about reading books is its power to transport me to different locations whilst Iâ€™m still on my couch. It is a low budget travel option that I often take!  Here are few books that i love among many other:</br>

			<h3 class="c">Sports</h3>

			There are different outdoor games i love to play. It is more of a workout regime for me. I still remember the days when i would be the first one to reach to the field after school with my football or cricket bat and play badminton at evening during winter. Even though i dont get much time to play like before, still sometimes i find ways to do what i love that is play. Here are the sports I love:</br>

			<h3 class="c">Movies and TV Series</h3>

			Watching movie and TV series is the best way to spend my leisure time. It can refresh my mind. Another important reasons to watch this is to acquire lessons from it. These lessons allows to appreciate and enjoy life. Here are some of my favourite movies and TV series:</br>
